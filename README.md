Justify
My competition entry for Ludum Dare 27.  
Reddit.php taken from https://github.com/jcleblanc/reddit-php-sdk and hacked a bit to allow self posts.  

Everything else is basic javascript.  When the game is done, it pushes to a php script that posts the results to reddit using the reddit.php calls.  

Not much more to say about it!
